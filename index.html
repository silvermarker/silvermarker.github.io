        <p>
          There are no words or love paragraphs that can adequately convey my
          emotions towards you, but I will not give up trying; you are the love
          of my life and the apple of my eye, and I would go to any length to
          ensure that you are content in your relationship with me. My
          relationship with you extends beyond that of a crime-fighting partner
          to one in which you are also the answer to my prayers.
